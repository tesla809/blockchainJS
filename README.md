# blockchainJS
Building a blockchain in JavaScript using ES6 for learning purposes


## Project Overview
We will be building: 
- A blockchain
- Test for our blockchain
- API (server) to interact with our blockchain from the internet
- Upgrade API to a decentralized blockchain network to host our blockchain via various nodes
- Consensus algorithm to make sure our data is legitimate and always synchronized across all our nodes
- a Block Explorer to explore our data via a user interface

Our blockchain will be able to:
- Perform Proof of Work to secure the blockchain
- Create new blocks through mining process
- Create new and immutable transactions
- valdiate the blockchain and all block data 
- Retreive address, transaction, and block data
- and other features
